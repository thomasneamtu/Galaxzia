This is an objects oriented game called Galaxzia.

I learned quite a bit during this project, this was a real indepth experience of creation within coding, creating multple different enemy types,
creating powerups and allowing for a score system to motivate more playtime.

This was a fun project I really got hands on with the visuals and the sound effects, I really wanted the game to feel like you were standing at an arcade machine playing.
I used Shaders for the first time as well as cinemachine and a small bit of AI within the enemies.


A 2D Retro Survival Space Shooter.


A project created while doing my Game Dev course with Circuit Stream.
